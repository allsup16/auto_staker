This project is to create a auto stake trading bot that takes usdc, buy ehtereum and stake's the bought ethereum
I am doing this in order to set the ground work for future crypto trader and learn typescript, get better with git and
learn how to use a hetzner server with linux.


Refactor List:
    split helper method into individual files that target specific functionality.
    implement into hetzner or at least a non local machine.
    switch the writeinstructions to be outside main loop and inside functions that would change the instructions
        -This would limit the amount of rewrites to only happen when needed
